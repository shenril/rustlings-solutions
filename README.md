# rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

Greetings and welcome to `rustlings`. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

_...looking for the old, web-based version of Rustlings? Try [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/rustlings-1)_

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there's several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online

## Notice

**This is my own solutions to the rustlings exercises.**

**PLEASE DO NOT CHEAT YOURSELF OUT OF THESE EXERCISES.**

I highly recommend to read the Rust book first on search A LOT before looking at my solutions. 
The main purpose is to learn, not to copy/paste my version of it. 

**This repo is to be used only for LAST RESORT !!!**


If you notice errors please let me know, rustlings watch was all-green at the time I pushed this repo.
